# Guides and Trainings
Your time in the Junior Academy only gives a limited idea of how a professional application could look like.
To get a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, you can refer to the following documentations and courses.

Don't know where to start in general?
Take a look [here](https://roadmap.sh/) to find a skill or role you want to work on. The plans can give you a good hint on where to start or what is still missing to master a skill.

## Books/Publications/Authors
A note on these books: a lot of them are rather old (written before 2000). Those books are not so much focused on a technology (e.g. ML, a programming language etc.) that changes fast. They're mainly about culture and methodology that has been very precise for a lot of common problems in software development (we still often have to deal with these problems despite knowing it better for centuries...). 
* [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/de/manifesto.html) - and the 12 principles of agile software development. This is the foundation of basically all agile methods you find out there.  
    Also take a look at the authors of this manifesto - all of them are respected professionals in the software development community and wrote excellent books and articles on how to develop good software and on how to become a professional software developer
* Robert C. Martin  
  * Clean Code   
    how to write readable, maintainable software - you learned that for example with naming your variables and writing small methods etc.
  * Clean Coder  
    This book focuses on the human that writes code. What moral and characteristics should you have to be a professional?
  * All books by this author :)
* Michael C. Feathers
  * Effektives Arbeiten mit Legacy Code  
    Book on how to work with code that is somewhat messed up or hard to change/read. Excellent read - even when you don't work with legacy systems
* Frederick P. Brooks
  * Vom Mythos des Mann-Monats  
    Quote: “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.” 
* Eric Freeman et al.
  * Entwurfsmuster von Kopf bis Fuß  
  This book is about design patterns. These patterns offer solutions for common problems in software development (and examples on how not to solve a common problem). Those patterns can be used independent from any programming language.
* Martin Fowler
  * Refactoring   
  A book on how to change existing code without breaking its functionality or cause harm to the user of the software 
  * Feature Toggles ([Article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html))  
  Feature toggles help developing and releasing software and keep control over what a customer can actually use of this software 
* Kent Beck
  * Test Driven Development  
    Writing tests eliminates fear of breaking stuff when developing software. Writing tests before implementing the business logic comes with a lot of advantages. TDD is a practice we strictly follow at the Audi SDC.
  * Extreme Programming Explained  
    eXtreme Programming (XP) is also something the SDC practices. XP is an agile software development framework to improve software quality, managing risk (of failure or higher costs) by releasing software often. 
  * JUnit  
    JUnit is a popular test framework for Java. It was created by the books author (Kent Beck) and another expert within the industry - Erich Gamma. Any questions on how to use it correct? Here you will find them
  * All books by this author :)
* David Thomas & Andrew Hunt
  * Der pragmatische Programmierer  
    Various Tips on how to become a professional software developer and how to tackle common problems. Contains lot's of best practices.
* Gene Kim et al.
  * Das DevOps-Handbuch  
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophy, methodology and tools to increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity and proper quality. 
  * Projekt Phoenix  
  A novel (yes this is not your typical tech book) about an IT manager and his journey to save a chaotic IT project called "project phoenix".
  * Projekt Unicorn  
  Adds the perspective of the software developer working on project phoenix.
* Christian Ullenbook
  * Java ist auch eine Insel  
    Very good book to learn OOP - object oriented programming (in general) using the Java language. 
* Luc Perkins et al. 
  * Seven Databases in Seven Weeks  
  A very good overview about different databases (most of them not-relational). Including the core concepts and also some advanced features of the databases, and how to use them.
